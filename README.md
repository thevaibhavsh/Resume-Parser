# Creating an Automated Resume Parser in Python: Streamline Your Recruitment Process

Parsing resumes manually is time-consuming and prone to errors. Are you looking to speed up candidate screening by automating resume processing? A resume parser can help you save time and avoid manual data entry. In this guide, we’ll show you how to build a resume parser that extracts key information like name, contact details, skills, experience, and education from resumes in PDF formats.

This blog post demonstrates how to build a Python-powered resume parser to extract essential candidate information efficiently. We’ll dive into the technical steps, using the `pdfminer` library to pull text from resumes, `re` for regular expression-based extractions, and `spaCy` for advanced natural language processing, this parser can retrieve details such as:

- **Name, Contact Number, and Email**: Basic contact info extracted accurately using NLP and regex.
- **Skills**: Match specific technical skills from a customizable list.
- **Education & College Name**: Detects educational degrees.
- **Designation and Work Experience**: Captures relevant job titles and experience length.
- **Page Count**: Determines the number of pages, useful for filtering lengthy resumes.

By the end, you’ll have a functioning resume parser that can integrate with your hiring platform, making it easier to sort through applicants efficiently. Whether you’re a recruiter or developer, this project can save time and enhance your hiring workflow.

Through this guide, you’ll gain insights into combining NLP, regex, and text extraction libraries to automate resume parsing for hiring workflows, saving hours of manual effort.
